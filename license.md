LICENSE

To kick things off (and keep things simple) we are using a simple "all rights reserved" publication model.

We welcome any and all suggested changes to our events and our documentation, but are not yet equipped to compensate contributors for suggestions that get adopted.

That said, we are trying to build more than a company here, we are trying to build a community that will change the world.

Contributions build relationships and relationships create value. And we will work to find ways to reward community members for helping us create value.

Down the line, we would like to adopt a structure that is somewhat similar to that adopted by Quirky for their P2P invention platform:

However, flushing out all of those details (for our context) will take more time and effort than we have at the moment and will have to be worked out over time.

If you have any proposals in terms of licensing structures for our community, please send them to us.

We could use the help and would like to see this kick off a whole new field of "blended source" licensing.

I just made that term up.

Here is a rough draft of what I am aiming for when I use that term:

1) We want to make it easy for people to be able to build upon one another's efforts (to collaborate).

2) We want to enable people to extract value from their contributions -- so that the act of contributing can be a sustaining endeavor -- and not just a subsidized one.

3) We believe that traditional copyright based structures for incentivizing contributions are poor tools -- primarily because the cost of enforcement (a lawsuit) dramatically outweighs the value at stake in most cases.

4) We believe that Open Source structures are wonderful in that they enable people to build upon one another's works with minimal friction.

5) However, we also believe that such structures are problematic because they require subsidization (either by a dayjob, consulting work, or some ancillary business model) and are thus not self-sustaining.

6) We believe that different forms of reputation systems and criteria-based publication (where you only get access to some resource if you satisfy the criteria set forward by the licensor) are a better set of enforcement mechanisms.

7) We believe that an ecosystem of criteria-based publication templates and reputation tools will enable "Blended Licensing" to become the standard structure for publication in general -- not just of the types of creative works that are covered by copyright law, but of a wider variety of human endeavors that are able to be communicated through electronic media (and possibly even beyond that).
