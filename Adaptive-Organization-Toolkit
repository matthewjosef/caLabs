ADAPTIVE ORGANIZATION TOOLKIT

This is a collection of tools that Collaborative Advantage and our clients and broader community have found useful for helping build an adaptive organization.

Take them, try them, tweak them, share them, and send us your suggestions on how to improve them.  

1) eSOPs
2) Periodic Personal Business Model Canvas
3) A culture of anti-fragility
4) How to build trust
5) Building a practice of communication (hint: it isn't the same as a policy of transparency)
6) Speech, Writing and Action.
7) Tension Finder
8) Mentorship vs Facilitation
