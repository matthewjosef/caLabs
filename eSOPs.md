eSOPs: An introduction

Standard Operating Procedures -- exactly how you're hoping to spend Friday night, right?  The problem with most SOP's is that:

1) they "standardize" situations that might be "quite different on the ground,"

2) they don't empower the people actually relying upon them to tamper with the "sacred book,"

3) because of this "lack of fit" and "disempowerment," they fail to facilitate communication and thus limit the evolution and execution of <strike>best</strike> better practices across the organization.


At the same time, you don't want each person on your team to have to reinvent the wheel.

We've created a process for using and improving "SOPs."  We call them Evolving Standard Operating Procedures (eSOPs) because that is our goal -- to have them be a tool that improves the flow of knowledge and wisdom across our organization -- and that leverages everyone on the team -- from the oldest of old hands to the most ignorant newbie.

We believe that fresh eyes can see assumptions and opportunities for adjustment that veterans can't.  At the same time, old hands possess a depth of familiarity that enables them to understand the nuance and connectedness of their ecosystem that are invisible to a new arrival.

So what are eSOPs?
They are the product of a process.

Giving a title. Giving a responsibility.
