eSOPs: An introduction

Standard Operating Procedures -- exactly how you're hoping to spend Friday night, right?  The problem with most SOP's is that:
1) they "standardize" situations that might be "quite different on the ground,"
2) they don't empower the people actually relying upon them to tamper with the "sacred book,"
3) because of this "lack of fit" and "disempowerment," they fail to facilitate communication and thus limit the evolution and execution of <strike>best</strike> better practices across the organization.
